## Profile

I am an IT Professional that is self-motivated and able to adapt to any kind of technology with a focus on its use in Education. I am also a competent [NodeJS] developer with the drive and motivation to make applications and tools to improve the workflow of everyone I work with.

## Current Work

### Senior IT Engineer at Ed-IT Solutions (2008-Present)

I am responsible for maintaining the IT systems at a few primary schools as well as working with other engineers to improve the systems in every school [Ed-IT Solutions] works in.

Day to day I perform regular _maintenance visits_ to the schools I am assigned and whilst on site I will work through the open tickets and liaise with staff to get issues resolved quickly and to a high standard. In 2015 I helped move our support system over to a web based ticket system with email integration.

Outside of regular visits I undertake _project work_ which takes the form of:

  - SIMS Upgrades and Transfers
  - Server & Domain Builds and Installation
  - Network Stack Installation
  - And any other jobs to disruptive to do during a normal visit.

I handle all software & hardware deployments in the schools I support, as well as advising the school about how best to develop their IT.

My work also includes development of applications for use in the company and the schools we support. Internally I created and maintain a Rails application that handles our stock control, purchasing and sales.

I also work closely with our Designer to turn his website designs into Wordpress themes. I then help to deploy the finished website to the schools web server.

Some of the work I perform gets written up on my [blog](http://arcath.net/blog.html) under [work](http://arcath.net/categories/work.html).

## Past Work
