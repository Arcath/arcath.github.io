# CV

## Profile

I am an IT Professional that is self motivated and able to adapt to any kind of technology with a focus on its use in Education. I am also a competent [Ruby] developer with the drive and motivation to make applications and tools to improve the workflow of everyone I work with.

## Current Work

###Â Senior IT Engineer at Ed-IT Solutions (2008-Present)

I am responsible for maintaining the IT systems at a few primary schools as well as working with other engineers to improve the systems in every school [Ed-IT Solutions] works in.

The work I undertake in schools covers the whole spectrum from in situe hardware maintenance to domain & server upgrades. Whilst on site for a normal _maintenance visit_ I fill every role in the _IT department_ and will go from re connecting a device in a classroom to a meeting with SLT about new hardware procurement.

I handle all software & hardware deployments in the schools I support, as well as advising the school about how best to develop their IT.

### Web Developer at Ed-IT Solutions (2008-Present)

I maintain and setup websites for the schools that [Ed-IT Solutions] supports and run a couple of [Rails] applications for the company.

The school websites are all PHP/MySQL sites that usually run Site@School or Wordpress. I would usually make the template and populate the site to begin with then hand of the maintenance responsibility to the school only going back into the site when something in the template needed changing or there was something new that they wanted to do.
