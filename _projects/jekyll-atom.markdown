Jekyll-Atom is a [Atom] Package for working with [Jekyll] sites which moves most of your workflow into Atom.

It can:

  - Run a local server to preview your site
    - This runs in Atom with no child processes
    - Whilst running any time you save your site will be re-built.
  - Build your site from a command
  - Create new posts
  - Manage drafts
