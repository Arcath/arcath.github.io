Welcome to my new Blog!

I've been thinking about the best way to communicate some of the more random rubbish that I generate and with my custom written blogs I've always had the issue that to post $thing required $feature to be written first and I just lost interest. I am obviously over valuing what I have to say but some of it should be of some help to people.

I will try and post here about my coding work, possibly even about the work I do at [Ed-IT Solutions](http://www.ed-itsolutions.com) although most of my work there involves schools and details that can't be shared freely.

I chose to use [Octopress](http://octopress.org) with github pages hosting so that I still get to use git for version control and deployments as well as using a pre made blogging framework.

I could have used wordpress or something similar but I have no way of hosting PHP + MySQL easily and its been a long time since I did anything with it.

Stay tuned for some new content here, there will be some re posting of articles I had written before just so its all in one place.
